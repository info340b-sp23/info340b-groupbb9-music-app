      <!-- Problem Description -->
      <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on the topic of music-centered social media web application. With so many artists, songs, and genres of music out there, 
          it can be overwhelming for people to try and find new music. It can also be hard to know what music your friends are listening to. 
          Also, some people only want to follow their friends' feed in terms of music content exclusively, not every detail about their lives. 
          That is what we are trying to solve with our music sharing application. 
          Currently, Spotify has a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/friend-activity/">“listening now”</a> feature where you can view what your friends are listening to at that moment, or what the last song they listened to was. 
          This can be great if you are on Spotify at the same time as your friends, 
          but it doesn't allow users to curate the content that they are sharing and deprives the social connection from friends who don't use Spotify.

  <!-- Proposed application -->
  <section>
    <h2>Proposed application</h2>
    <p>We propose creating a music social media application where users can post a favorite song that they have been listening to each day. Other users can see these posts from the people they are connected with and like, comment, and react to their friends’ posts. This can help people to see what songs their friends are listening to and discover new music.</p>
    <p>Typical users could include highschool and college students who enjoy music and enjoy sharing their music taste with friends. The key features will include: (1) Posting your daily song (large), (2) reacting and commenting on their friends’ songs and viewing their profile (half), and (3) creating a personalized user profile where users can add a profile photo, short bio, and share their favorite artists and genres (large). A post will contain the album artwork, song name, artist name(s), and potentially a button to listen to a snippet of the song or a link to the song on YouTube. We will have users submit the song name, artist name, album name, and a YouTube link to the song. Our app will allow users to discover new music and learn more about their friends’ music taste. It gives users an opportunity to share how their day is going and the vibes that they are bringing to the day. Details such as the artist name, album name, song title, User's Profile Page will contain bio or a list of related songs or artists.</p>
    <p>Now most of the music streaming platform face challenges such as complicated user interfaces, slow loading times, or limited features that affect the overall user experience, most importantly, they do not support voice over function that support people with visual impairment, whether they may not be optimized for accessibility or ompatibility with assistive technologies, they are an issue. For example, images, buttons, and other important interface elements may not be labeled with proper alt tags, which makes it difficult for screen readers to interpret and relay the information to the user.</p>
    <p>While trying to solve the issue above with option shuch as alternative text descriptions, keyboard accessibility and text-to-speech, we also seek improvement of the service. There is a possibility that certain genres of music favored by minority groups might not receive as much attention as those preferred by mainstream users. Also, every user has their own preferred music streaming platform, but we will address this by providing links to different platforms for the users to listen on. For example, Apple music users might be hesitant to share their daily music with friends who prefer to use Spotify if they do not have a Spotify account. With our music application, users can share their favorite music regardless of the type of music platform as well as interact with their followers/following by reacting and commenting on their daily music like other social media platforms.</p>
