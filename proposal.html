    <h2>Proposed application</h2>
    <p>We propose creating a music social media application where users can post a favorite song that they have been listening to each day. Other users can see these posts from the people they are connected with and like, comment, and react to their friends’ posts. This can help people to see what songs their friends are listening to and discover new music.</p>
    <p>Typical users could include highschool and college students who enjoy music and enjoy sharing their music taste with friends. The key features will include: (1) Posting your daily song (large), (2) reacting and commenting on their friends’ songs and viewing their profile (half), and (3) creating a personalized user profile where users can add a profile photo, short bio, and share their favorite artists and genres (large). A post will contain the album artwork, song name, artist name(s), and potentially a button to listen to a snippet of the song or a link to the song on a streaming platform such as Spotify or YouTube. To do this we can connect to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-track">Spotify API</a> or the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">YouTube API</a> to load music metadata.</p>
